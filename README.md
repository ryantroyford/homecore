### home x core

in an effort to reduce my dependency on harmful chemicals, wasteful packaging, and unecessary spending, i recently began expirementing with making my own cleaning & personal products at home. 

the idea for this was in large part thanks to [a wonderful book by Raleigh Briggs](http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/2333/) that i happened upon. the idea to open-source it on github came from Dan Sinker's open-source taco repo [tacofancy](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy).

i encourage everyone to fork the project and add their own recipes. **they must be able to made at home with relative ease, using people/pet/earth-friendly ingredients.** together we can stick it to the man & have fun doing it.
