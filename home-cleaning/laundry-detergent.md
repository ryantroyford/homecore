### laundry detergent

---

there are countless variations of this recipe, but they're all more-or-less the same. this is the how-to page for powder detergent, which is easier to store, easier to make, and you need less of it per load. some people prefer liquid soap, a recipe for which is also in the home cleaning section.

```
laundry detergent (powder)

* 1 bar natural soap (Dr. Bronners unscented, Fels Naptha, etc.)
* 1 cup borax
* 1 cup washing soda

 - grate the soap with a cheese grater
 - mix ingredients together
```

start with `1 tbsp` per load, up to 3 for super dirty washes.
