### easy sticker removal

---

so you tried to peel the sticker off that cool looking wine bottle, and shit hit the fan. have no fear my friend. this trick works suprisingly well on even the most stubborn sticker residue.

this works best when the paper top layer of the sticker is removed. soaking it in water and scraping it with the dull edge of a butter knife is a good place to start.

```
easy sticker removal recipe

* one part baking soda
* one part cooking oil (olive oil works fine)

 - mix the ingredients together
 - drop a dab of it on your sticker residue
 - rub it around on the problem area, covering it
 - let it sit for 30 minutes
 - scrub off with a scouring pad
```

...and that's it. `1 tbsp` of each is a good place to begin, and from there you can add more of each, in equal amounts, if need be. after you're done, give it a nice rinse with soap & water to get rid of the oil.
