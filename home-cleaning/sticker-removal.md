### easy sticker removal

---

so you tried to peel the sticker off that cool looking wine bottle, and shit hit the fan. have no fear my friend, we're here to help.

before i get started, let me just say this this shit worked phenomenally well. i was seriously surprised, both with the simplicity and the result. the sticker i tested it on was one seriously stubborn motherfucker, so if it worked like a charm on that, i have confidence it can help you out, too. 

(it's also worth noting that i had removed most of the paper top layer of the sticker by soaking it in hot water and scraping it with a butter knife. that came off fine, but the tacky residue underneath would not budge)

```
 *easy sticker removal recipe*

 * one part baking soda
 * one part cooking oil 


mix the ingredients together. 
drop a dab of it on your sticker residue. 
rub it around on the problem area, covering it. 
let it sit for 30 minutes. 
scrub off with a scouring pad.
```

...and that's it. seriously. i usually start with `1 tbsp` each, and then add more of each, in equal amounts, if need be. after your done, give it a nice rinse with soap & water to get rid of the oil. i used olive oil, but i don't think that's imperative.
