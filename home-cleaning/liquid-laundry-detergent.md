### liquid laundry detergent

---
_another recipe from my buddy Tyler Deal. his mother is the queen of this stuff._

this makes quite a bit of laundry soap, so it's best to have a big, sealable container. those 5-gallon water jugs work pretty well, and you can pick them up fairly cheap.

```
laundry detergent (liquid)

* 1/3 bar natural soap (Fels Naptha, Dr. Bronners unscented, etc.)
* 1/2 C washing soda
* 1/2 C borax powder
* a good bit of water (roughly 34 C total)

 - grate soap into 6 C water. heat until the soap is melted
 - mix in other ingredients
 - pour 4 C warm water into your container
 - pour in soap mixture
 - add 1.5 gallons (24 C) of water to the container, and let sit for 24 hours

```

start with 1/2 C per load, or 1 C for the extra dirty stuff. the soap will be more of a gel, but it works great. this much will last you a loooong time.
