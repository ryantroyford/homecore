a note on paper towels:

paper towels are wasteful. they suck bigtime. i will concede that _sometimes_, they can be the right the for the job, but that "sometimes" has been grossly inflated by our disposable culture. there are far better ways to handle spills, wiping down countertops & windows, etc. 

a simple & reusable alternative: go to the thrift store, buy a couple towels, and cut them in quarters. i keep a small plastic bin under the kitchen sink, and when one of the towel quarters has been used to it's fullest, i toss it in there. whenever i do laundry, i just grab that bin, dump the towels in there, and they're good as new to use again.
