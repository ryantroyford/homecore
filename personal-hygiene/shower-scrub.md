### shower scrub

---

_this recipe is a slightly modified version of one i got from my good buddy [Tyler Deal](http://idiotpull.com/)_.

if you're looking for a simple, no-bullshit concoction to scrub your body with when you're trying to get clean, look no further. this recipe in particular lends itself well to "freestyling," so don't worry about being precise, and try some variations if you're feeling bold. old shower gel or shampoo bottles work great for this, and it's a nice opportunity to recycle.

```
simple shower scrub

* about 1 cup of unscented castille soap
* 5-6 tbsp olive oil
* 6-8 drops essential oil of your choice 
	(try mixing & matching - i use lavender a lot, or tea tree + sandalwood)
* 1/4 cup water

 - mix the ingredients together in your container
 - shake before each use
```

now go out in the world and do good, you beautiful smelling creature.
