### shampoo alternatives

---

this may sound like hippy nonsense, but did you know you don't really need shampoo? nope. you just don't need it. instead of stripping all the oils off the scalp every day, only to try and replenish them with conditioner (seems a bit unnecessary, right?), try rinsing once a week with some diluted apple cider vinegar. it'll take some time to adjust, but after a while, your hair gets used to not being fucked with every day, and begins to balance out the natural oils. 

i like to steep some herbs in mine to add a little power and make it smell slightly nicer, so you're welcome to try that, too.

separate from the vinegar rinse, some folks also opt to sprinkle a little baking soda on their noggin and scrub it out in the shower. 

```
vinegar rinse

* 3/4 cup of apple cider vinegar
* 4 cups hot water

* 2 tbsp rosemary
* 2 tbsp nettles
* 2 tbsp chamomile

 - toss the bag in a large container with the vinegar. 
 - pour the hot water over top.
 - let steep over night, then remove the herbs & use.

```

if you don't want to do the herb thing, no biggie. just omit them, mix the vinegar & water, and go nuts.
