### deodorant

---

_this recipe is a slightly modified version of one found online at [Becoming Peculiar](http://becomingpeculiar.com/)_.

personally, this is some of the most effective deodorant i've come across. if your body isn't used to natural deodorant, it may take a little while for it to adjust, so don't worry if you reek for the first couple days.

the best container for this is an empty deodorant stick. once you finish up the last of your store-bought stuff, hang on to it. you'll pour the finished product in there, and once it solidifies, you'll be able to twist it up as needed just like anything else. 

```
beeswax deodorant

* 1 tbsp grated beeswax
* 3 tbsp coconut oil
* 1/4 C cornstarch or arrowroot powder
* 1/4 C baking soda
* 5-7 drops tea tree oil
* 5-7 drops essential oil of your choice (optional. i like to add lavender or lemon verbena)

 - using a double boiler, melt the beeswax and coconut oil together 
 - add in the other ingredients
 - stir everything together into a paste, making sure the mix is consistent
 - working quickly, pour the melted deodorant into your empty deodorant stick

```

let that badboy cool, and you're good to go. don't skip out on the tea tree oil or baking soda - from my experience those are definitely essential parts of the mix, unless you want to smell like Burning Man.
