### deodorant

---

_this recipe is a slightly modified version of one found online at [Becoming Peculiar](http://becomingpeculiar.com/)_.

personally, this is the most effective deodorant i've come across. if your body isn't used to natural deodorant, it may take a little while for it to adjust, so don't worry if you reek for the first couple days.
